# Plan-Ahead-App

This is an app i've made for one of my assignments. Its just a simple to-do app with an alarm system built in. 
The alarm is fairly faulty but with the right tinkering its should become better because there alot of room for improvement.

Any use from personally to commercially of this app, I just request i know what its being used for :). I'll just be intrigued.

Play around with it, fix it or find a new use for it choice is yours. Enjoy.
