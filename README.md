# Plan-Ahead-App

This is an app i've made for one of my assignments. Its a simple to-do app with an alarm system built in. 
The alarm is fairly faulty but if your looking for something to tinker with it should be easy to find because there alot of room for improvement. 
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Any use from personally to commercially of this app, I just request i know what its being used for :). I'll just be intrigued.

Play around with it, fix it or find a new use for it choice is yours. Enjoy.
